# Next js + Netlify Starter

Clone from https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-starter

-------

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v10.0.4 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/Bk4UicocL)!

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 2 sample components, a global stylesheet, a `netlify.toml` for deployment, and a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
